# getflags

A simple hacky script for getting sumbissions to 'The NZ flag â€“ your chance to decide' gallery. Flags can be seen in the `img` directory.

This is code is terribly written. Of particular note is the awful `while` loop which breaks based on a user-specified flag count global variable. A less lazy person could write something far more elegant.
